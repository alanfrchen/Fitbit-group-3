## Introduction

This project analyses FitBit usage data from 33 respondents to an Amazon survey in 2016. The goal is to provide interactive visualizations and statistical insights into participants' daily activity, sleep patterns, heart rate, weight, and more — presented through a multi-page Streamlit dashboard.

## Features

* Individual user profiles — filter by user ID and date range to explore personal metrics
* Calories & steps tracking — daily calorie burn, step counts, and activity breakdowns
* OLS regression — steps-to-calories regression model with per-user effects (R² = 0.793)
* Sleep analysis — distribution of sleep durations, weekday vs. weekend comparisons, and individual timelines
* Weight & BMI monitoring — time-series plots with overweight threshold reference
* Heart rate & exercise intensity — high-resolution heart rate data combined with intensity metrics
* Time-of-day analysis — average steps, calories, and sleep broken down into 4-hour blocks
* Weather impact analysis — correlation between Chicago weather (rain, temperature) and activity levels
* Cross-metric correlation heatmap — steps, calories, sedentary time, and sleep

## Data Sources

The SQLite database (`fitbit_database.db`) contains the following tables:

| Table              | Description                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `daily_activity`   | Daily totals for steps, distance, calories, activity     |
| `heart_rate`       | Heart rate measured every 5 seconds                      |
| `hourly_calories`  | Calories burned per hour                                 |
| `hourly_intensity` | Exercise intensity per hour (total and average)          |
| `hourly_steps`     | Step count per hour                                      |
| `minute_sleep`     | Sleep state logged every minute                          |
| `weight_log`       | Weight, body fat %, and BMI measurements                 |

Weather data for Chicago (April 2016) was sourced from
